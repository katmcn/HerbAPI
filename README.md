# HerbAPI
## Why I created this project

As part of the Software Bootcamp with QA, we were required to create a Spring Boot API to demonstrate our knowledge on the subject matter. The back-end development was done with the Java language, the database used was H2 and API requests were tested with Postman. 
For this independent project, I decided to create an API for the storing and referencing of information on medicinal herbs. This is a personal interest for which I have built the start of an app that will aid in my continued learning of the subject.

## Project expectations 
I was excited for the challenge of creating my first ever product, however, I was admittedly a bit nervous as I had not done anything like this prior. The tutors were really supportive which made the task much less daunting than expected.

## What went well? / What didn't go as planned?
Overall, this project was a success. Not only did I create a working API to aid in a personal learning project, but I was also able to test and solidify 10 weeks of learning. Independently creating the project from scratch helped me understand the content Iâ€™ve been taught this year. Post project, my confidence in this area has risen.
Some aspects were challenging, in particular, using Git/GitHub and testing were two areas I struggled with the most. However, the extra hours I put into learning about these two topics paid off and I now have a both a solid understanding and practical experience on them. 

## Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.
This is a project I would like to continue working on. I would like to first add additional tables, these being for medicinal properties and active constituents relevant to herbal medicine. Then I would need to set up a connection to a stored database so I can begin to collect data. And finally, I would like to create a frontend to make the software user friendly.
